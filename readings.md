# Readings

Many of my thoughts are being shaped by these readings, which have profoundly influenced my approach to research and design. These papers focus on interaction design, programming interfaces, and cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction.

## Interface Design Theory

### [[Reification, Polymorphism and Reuse]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon & Wendy E. Mackay (2000)*

Explores three fundamental principles that shape modern interface design, showing how abstract concepts can be made tangible and manipulable.

### [[Instrumental Interaction]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2000)*

Introduces a powerful model for thinking about interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments, drawing parallels with physical tools.

### [[Designing Interaction, not Interfaces]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2004)*

Argues for a paradigm shift from interface design to interaction design, emphasizing the importance of interaction models over widget design.

## Programming Interfaces

### [[Demonstrational Interfaces]]
*by B.A. Myers (1992)*

Explores how users can create abstract procedures through concrete demonstrations, laying the groundwork for modern programming-by-example systems.

### [[Ultra-Lightweight Constraints]]
*by Scott E. Hudson & Ian Smith (1996)*

Presents an efficient approach to implementing constraints in user interface toolkits, enabling dynamic layout updates.

### [[Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments]]
*by T.R.G. Green & M. Petre (1996)*

Introduces the cognitive dimensions framework for evaluating programming environments, providing a vocabulary for discussing their usability aspects.

## Cognitive Foundations

### [[Cognitive Engineering]]
*by Donald A. Norman (1986)*

Presents a seven-stage model of user interaction that has become fundamental to understanding human-computer interaction.

### [[Direct Manipulation Interfaces]]
*by Edwin L. Hutchins, James D. Hollan & Donald A. Norman (1985)*

Examines the cognitive aspects of direct manipulation interfaces, exploring both their benefits and limitations.

### [[Thinking with External Representations]]
*by David Kirsh (2010)*

Investigates why and how people use external representations to support thinking and problem-solving.

## Theoretical Frameworks

### [[What Is Interaction?]]
*by Kasper Hornb√¶k & Antti Oulasvirta (2017)*

Explores the fundamental concept of interaction in HCI, examining various theoretical perspectives and their implications.

## Design & Usability

### <a href="/readings/design-of-everyday-things" class="wiki-link">The Design of Everyday Things</a>
*by Donald A. Norman*

This foundational text explores how design serves as the communication between product and user, championing user-centered design principles. Norman's concepts of affordances, signifiers, and mental models have deeply influenced my approach to designing programming interfaces.

## Programming & Computer Science

### <a href="/readings/art-of-computer-programming" class="wiki-link">The Art of Computer Programming</a>
*by Donald E. Knuth*

Knuth's magnum opus provides a deep mathematical foundation for algorithms and programming techniques. While challenging, these volumes offer insights into the theoretical underpinnings of efficient computation.

### <a href="/readings/pragmatic-programmer" class="wiki-link">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>
*by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas*

This practical guide to software craftsmanship offers timeless advice on code quality, professional development, and effective programming practices. Its philosophy of pragmatism over dogmatism resonates strongly with my approach to tool design.

## Software Development Process

### <a href="/readings/mythical-man-month" class="wiki-link">The Mythical Man-Month</a>
*by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.*

Brooks' essays on software project management offer timeless insights into why adding more programmers to a late project makes it later. His discussion of conceptual integrity and the challenges of collaboration inform my research on collaborative programming tools.

### <a href="/readings/psychology-of-computer-programming" class="wiki-link">The Psychology of Computer Programming</a>
*by Gerald M. Weinberg*

Weinberg examines programming as a human activity, exploring how psychological factors affect code quality and team dynamics. This human-centered view of programming has profoundly shaped my research into programming interfaces and tools.
