# Readings

Many of my thoughts are being shaped by these readings, which have profoundly influenced my approach to research and design. Some are academic works, some are about day-to-day life, and others are simply enjoyable reads.

## Design & Usability

### <a href="/readings/design-of-everyday-things" class="wiki-link">The Design of Everyday Things</a>
*by Donald A. Norman*

This foundational text explores how design serves as the communication between product and user, championing user-centered design principles. Norman's concepts of affordances, signifiers, and mental models have deeply influenced my approach to designing programming interfaces.

## Programming & Computer Science

### <a href="/readings/art-of-computer-programming" class="wiki-link">The Art of Computer Programming</a>
*by Donald E. Knuth*

Knuth's magnum opus provides a deep mathematical foundation for algorithms and programming techniques. While challenging, these volumes offer insights into the theoretical underpinnings of efficient computation.

### <a href="/readings/pragmatic-programmer" class="wiki-link">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>
*by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas*

This practical guide to software craftsmanship offers timeless advice on code quality, professional development, and effective programming practices. Its philosophy of pragmatism over dogmatism resonates strongly with my approach to tool design.

## Software Development Process

### <a href="/readings/mythical-man-month" class="wiki-link">The Mythical Man-Month</a>
*by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.*

Brooks' essays on software project management offer timeless insights into why adding more programmers to a late project makes it later. His discussion of conceptual integrity and the challenges of collaboration inform my research on collaborative programming tools.

### <a href="/readings/psychology-of-computer-programming" class="wiki-link">The Psychology of Computer Programming</a>
*by Gerald M. Weinberg*

Weinberg examines programming as a human activity, exploring how psychological factors affect code quality and team dynamics. This human-centered view of programming has profoundly shaped my research into programming interfaces and tools.
