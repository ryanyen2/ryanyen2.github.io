# Readings

Many of my thoughts are being shaped by these readings, which have profoundly influenced my approach to research and design. These papers focus on interaction design, programming interfaces, and cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction.

## Interface Design Theory

### [[Reification, Polymorphism and Reuse]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon & Wendy E. Mackay (2000)*

Explores three fundamental principles that shape modern interface design, showing how abstract concepts can be made tangible and manipulable.

### [[Instrumental Interaction]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2000)*

Introduces a powerful model for thinking about interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments, drawing parallels with physical tools.

### [[Designing Interaction, not Interfaces]]
*by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2004)*

Argues for a paradigm shift from interface design to interaction design, emphasizing the importance of interaction models over widget design.

## Programming Interfaces

### [[Demonstrational Interfaces]]
*by B.A. Myers (1992)*

Explores how users can create abstract procedures through concrete demonstrations, laying the groundwork for modern programming-by-example systems.

### [[Ultra-Lightweight Constraints]]
*by Scott E. Hudson & Ian Smith (1996)*

Presents an efficient approach to implementing constraints in user interface toolkits, enabling dynamic layout updates.

### [[Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments]]
*by T.R.G. Green & M. Petre (1996)*

Introduces the cognitive dimensions framework for evaluating programming environments, providing a vocabulary for discussing their usability aspects.

## Cognitive Foundations

### [[Cognitive Engineering]]
*by Donald A. Norman (1986)*

Presents a seven-stage model of user interaction that has become fundamental to understanding human-computer interaction.

### [[Direct Manipulation Interfaces]]
*by Edwin L. Hutchins, James D. Hollan & Donald A. Norman (1985)*

Examines the cognitive aspects of direct manipulation interfaces, exploring both their benefits and limitations.

### [[Thinking with External Representations]]
*by David Kirsh (2010)*

Investigates why and how people use external representations to support thinking and problem-solving.

## Theoretical Frameworks

### [[What Is Interaction?]]
*by Kasper Hornb√¶k & Antti Oulasvirta (2017)*

Explores the fundamental concept of interaction in HCI, examining various theoretical perspectives and their implications.
