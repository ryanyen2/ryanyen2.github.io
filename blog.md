# Blog

Welcome to my blog where I share thoughts on research, programming interfaces, and design. These are informal explorations of ideas that often develop into more formal research projects.

### <a href="/blog/semi-formal-programming" class="wiki-link">Semi-formal Programming</a>
*March 12, 2025*

An exploration of the middle ground between formal programming languages and natural language, examining how new interfaces can bridge this gap.

### <a href="/blog/malleable-interaction-interface" class="wiki-link">Malleable Interaction Interface</a>
*December 28, 2024*

A discussion on the concept of malleable interaction interfaces, exploring how technology can adapt to human cognition rather than forcing humans to adapt to rigid technological constructs.
