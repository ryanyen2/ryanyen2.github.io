# Blog

Welcome to my blog where I share thoughts on research, programming interfaces, and design. These are informal explorations of ideas that often develop into more formal research projects.

*May 20, 2023*

An exploration of the middle ground between formal programming languages and natural language, examining how new interfaces can bridge this gap.

### <a href="/blog/domain-specific-languages" class="wiki-link">Domain Specific Languages</a>
*June 15, 2023*

How specialized languages can provide the right level of abstraction for different domains, making programming more accessible and expressive.

## Research Ideas

These are early thoughts that might develop into future research projects:

- **Embodied Programming**: How can we incorporate physical movement and spatial reasoning into programming interfaces?
- **Time-Travel Debugging Visualizations**: Novel visual representations for understanding program state over time
- **Collaborative Visual Programming**: Enabling real-time collaboration in visual programming environments

## Design Thoughts

- **The Aesthetics of Code**: How visual design principles can improve code readability and comprehension
- **Minimalist Programming Interfaces**: Reducing cognitive load through careful interface design
- **Animation in Programming Tools**: Using motion to convey program behavior and structure

Feel free to explore these topics and share your thoughts. Many of these ideas connect to my [[Publications]] and ongoing research projects.
