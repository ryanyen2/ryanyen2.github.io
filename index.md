## 哩賀 (lí hó) I am <span class="annotation-highlight"><b>Ryan Yen</b></span>
My present research interest are malleable programming interaction interface and [[semi-formal programming]]/ representation.

<!-- I will pursue my PhD at MIT CSAIL under the supervision of <a href='https://arvindsatya.com/' alt='arvind webstie'>Dr. Arvind Satyanarayan</a> to continue my research in programming interface. I studied master in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, mentored by <a href='https://www.jeffjianzhao.com/'>Dr. Jian Zhao </a> of the WVisdom Lab at UWaterloo. I was guided by Dr. Zhicong Lu from DEER Lab and Dr. Can Liu of the ERFI Lab at CityU HK. -->

### Publications
I have been thinking about programming in different ways:
- <span class="annotation-underline">Code Shaping</span>: Iterative Code Editing with Free-form Sketching
- <span class="annotation-underline">CoLadder</span>: Manipulating Code Generation via Multi-Level Blocks
- CoPrompt: Supporting Prompt Sharing and Referring in Collaborative Natural Language Programming


There are some works about information space too:
- Memolet: Reifying the Reuse of User-AI Conversational Memories
- To Search or To Gen? Exploring the Synergy between Generative AI and Web Search in Programming


Some of my ealy works that fading away:
- Gait Gestures: Examining Stride and Foot Strike Variation as an Input Method While Walking
- StoryChat: Designing a Narrative-Based Viewer Participation Tool for Live Streaming Chatrooms
- Gist and Verbatim: Understanding Speech to Inform New Interfaces for Verbal Text Composition
- Wizundry: A Cooperative Wizard of Oz Platform for Simulating Future Speech-based Interfaces with Multiple Wizards

### Thoughts 
I kept having random thought... and I kept all of them in the...
See more on my [[Blog]] where I discuss some of these in detail.


### Readings
Many of my thoughts are being shaped by these readings... which I found profoundly affecting me in the way of approaching research, some of them are about day-to-day life, some of them, just lovely to read.

- [[The Design of Everyday Things]]
- [[The Art of Computer Programming]]
- [[The Pragmatic Programmer]]
- [[The Mythical Man-Month]]
- [[The Psychology of Computer Programming]]
