## 哩賀(lí hó), I am <span class="annotation-highlight"><b>Ryan Yen</b></span> <img src="/assets/images/icons/work-with-cat.svg" alt="Work with Cat Icon" style="width: 36px; height: 36px; vertical-align: bottom;">
I do research, which means I spend my days banging my head against the wall trying to figure things out.

Overall, my thinking mostly revolves around AI-assisted programming interfaces. Currently, I'm exploring [[Semi-formal Programming]] at [MIT VIS Lab](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/), ~~the~~ a shared representation where both humans and machines can comfortably operate and co-evolve.

### Works
I’ve been thinking about enable programmers to program in different ways, and in different abstraciotns.

One example is [[Code Shaping]], where we explore using freeform sketching *on and around* code to edit it iteratively with GenAI, helping programmers express ideas at a much higher level of abstraction. Another is [[CoLadder]], which explores multi-level blocks for code generation, letting users manipulate abstraction layers dynamically.

I’ve also worked outside the programming space. In [[Memolet]], I looked at how we can reuse conversational memory in AI-human interactions. In [[To Search or To Gen?]], we explored how generative AI and web search could complement each other in programming.

### Reflections and Repentance
I spend many time reflecting on my thoughts... and I like writing them down.
If you’re curious about the things I’m noodling on, you’ll find more on my [[Blog]].

### Readings
A lot of my thinking is shaped by what I read. Honestly, reading feels like time-traveling conversations with other thinkers. Nerdy, I know, but it's true. I just wish I had more time to do it.

Some of the pieces that have stuck with me, including [[Reification, Polymorphism and Reuse]], Demonstrational Interfaces, Cognitive Engineering, Designing Interaction, not Interfaces, [[Instrumental Interaction]], [[Direct Manipulation Interfaces]], Thinking with External Representations, Ultra-Lightweight Constraints, What Is Interaction?, and Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments.
