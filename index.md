## Hey, I am <span class="annotation-highlight"><b>Ryan Yen</b></span>
I do research, which means I mostly spend my days hitting my head against the wall trying to figure things out.

Overal, my thinking mostly revolves around AI-driven programming interfaces. Currently, I'm exploring malleable programming interfaces and [[Semi-formal Programming]], ways to represent and work with code that sit somewhere between structure and informal representation.
Also, here's my [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/cv.pdf) if this is what you are looking for.

### Works
I’ve been thinking about enable programmers to program in different ways. I love writing code with a keyboard, but I don’t think it’s the only way to program (and it's not, coding ≠ typing code).

Lately, the whole “vibe coding” trend partially resonates with what I care about, though I want to push it further (or hold back a bit): I’m interested in preserving the *informality* and fluidity of that approach, while still introducing structure, so that it doesn’t backfire.

One example is [[Code Shaping]], where we explore using freeform sketching *on and around* code to edit it iteratively with GenAI, helping programmers express ideas at a much higher level of abstraction. Another is [[CoLadder]], which explores multi-level blocks for code generation, letting users manipulate abstraction layers dynamically.

I’ve also worked outside the programming space. In [[Memolet]], I looked at how we can reuse conversational memory in AI-human interactions. In [[To Search or To Gen?]], we explored how generative AI and web search could complement each other in programming. That said, I’ve stepped away from the “sensemaking” side of AI for now. It’s a deep space, and one I’d have to devote myself to completely. Even with Memolet, I felt like something was missing. There’s still no good way to represent the in-between space: the messy mental models we form while thinking, and the text that tries (and often fails) to capture them. We’re missing a middle layer, some kind of abstraction that helps externalize thought without asking too much of the reader. I don’t know what it is yet.

### Thoughts

I like writing things down... even if some of them are kind of half-baked. I revisit and update my ideas when I can.
If you’re curious about the things I’m noodling on, you’ll find more on my [[Blog]].

### Readings
A lot of my thinking is shaped by what I read. Honestly, reading feels like time-traveling conversations with other thinkers. Nerdy, I know, but it's true. I just wish I had more time to do it.

Some of the pieces that have stuck with me, including [[Reification, Polymorphism and Reuse]], [[Demonstrational Interfaces]], [[Cognitive Engineering]], [[Designing Interaction, not Interfaces]], [[Instrumental Interaction]], [[Direct Manipulation Interfaces]], [[Thinking with External Representations]], [[Ultra-Lightweight Constraints]], [[What Is Interaction?]], and [[Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments]].
