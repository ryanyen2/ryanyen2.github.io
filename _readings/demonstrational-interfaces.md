title: "Demonstrational Interfaces"
authors: "B.A. Myers"
year: 1992

abstract: "Demonstrational interfaces, interfaces that let the user perform actions on concrete example objects while constructing an abstract program, thus letting the user create parameterized procedures and objects without learning a programming language, are discussed."
reflection: "Myers' work on demonstrational interfaces laid the groundwork for modern programming-by-example systems. The idea that users can create abstract procedures through concrete demonstrations continues to influence my thinking about making programming more accessible."
