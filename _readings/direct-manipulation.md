abstract: "Direct manipulation has been lauded as a good form of interface design, and some interfaces that have this property have been well received by users. This article delves into the cognitive aspects of direct manipulation interfaces, examining both their advantages and disadvantages."
reflection: "This foundational paper on direct manipulation interfaces has been crucial in understanding both the benefits and limitations of direct manipulation in programming interfaces. The insights about cognitive distance and engagement continue to inform my research on making programming more intuitive."
