title: "Designing Interaction, not Interfaces"

abstract: "The paper argues for a shift from interface design to interaction design as the means to significantly enhance user interfaces. It calls for the development of powerful interaction models, a better understanding of sensory-motor aspects, and novel interaction architectures addressing key challenges like reinterpretability, resilience, and scalability."
reflection: "This seminal paper shifted my perspective from thinking about interfaces as static elements to considering them as dynamic interaction spaces. The emphasis on interaction models over widget design has deeply influenced my approach to programming interface design."
