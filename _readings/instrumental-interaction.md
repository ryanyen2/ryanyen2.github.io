abstract: "Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects."
reflection: "The concept of interaction instruments provides a powerful metaphor for thinking about interface design. This model has been particularly influential in my work on programming tools, where considering code elements as manipulable objects through specialized instruments has led to novel interface designs."
