abstract: "Reification turns concepts into first class objects, polymorphism permits commands to be applied to objects of different types, and reuse makes both user input and system output accessible for later use."
reflection: "This paper introduces three fundamental principles that have profoundly influenced modern interface design. The concept of reification particularly resonates with my research in programming interfaces, where making abstract concepts tangible and manipulable can significantly enhance the programming experience."
