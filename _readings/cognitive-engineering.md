abstract: "The seven-stage interaction model consists of (1) Establishing the Goal, (2) Forming the Intention, (3) Specifying the Action Sequence, (4) Executing the Action on the System's Interface, (5) Perceiving the System's State as a Response to the Action, (6) Interpreting the State, and (7) Evaluating the System State with respect to the Goals and Iterating until the goal is achieved."
reflection: "Norman's seven-stage model provides a crucial framework for understanding how users interact with interfaces. This systematic breakdown of interaction has been invaluable in my research on programming interfaces, helping me identify potential gaps between user intentions and system interpretations."
