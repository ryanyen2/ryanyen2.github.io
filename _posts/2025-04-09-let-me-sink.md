# Let Me Sink, Not Think

It’s honestly such a blessing that [[Code Shaping]] <img src="/assets/images/icons/draw-pad.svg" alt="Draw Pad Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;" /> has become more widespread. I’ve been lucky to have so many incredible people (investors, startup founders, and brilliant industry teams) reach out. I genuinely love chatting with them; they’re inspiring engineers, sharp thinkers, and incredibly accomplished in their own fields.

That said, I’ve also been feeling a little... swept up in the excitement. There’s been this windy indecision in me about whether I should lean further into code shaping and build something around it. It’s tempting. Really tempting.

But I went home, took a pause, did a bit of meditation… and I think, deep down, I realized it’s just not the right time. Right now, I’m working on something I’m genuinely excited about, and I feel incredibly grateful to be building it with Arvind, Josh, and the team. We’re having a great time, we believe in what we’re making, and we’re excited to see it come to life in the near future.

I think part of my hesitation comes from this lingering feeling that I’d be “wasting” such a great opportunity, or say passing up the chance to collaborate with amazing people or join a startup that might even rescue me from being broke! But I’ve already gained so much. I’ve had thoughtful conversations, made meaningful connections, and seen real interest in what I’m doing. Isn’t that already kind of amazing?

At the end of the day, I know I’m on the path that feels right to me right now. I’m keep learning and working on something that truly excites me. And when the day comes that we release it—please reach out again <img src="/assets/images/icons/good-face.svg" alt="Good Face Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;">.
