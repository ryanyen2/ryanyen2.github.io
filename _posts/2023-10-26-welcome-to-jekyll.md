# Welcome to My New Website

This is the first post on my <span class="annotation-highlight">newly designed</span> website. I've rebuilt everything from the ground up with a focus on readability and elegant typography.

## Design Philosophy

I believe in the power of <span class="annotation-underline">clean, readable text</span> as the foundation of good web design. This site prioritizes:

1. Excellent typography
2. Thoughtful spacing
3. Subtle animations
4. Readable content

## What's Next

I plan to write about various topics including:

- Design explorations
- Technical projects
- Personal reflections
