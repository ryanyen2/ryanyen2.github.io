I once explored the analogy that conducting research resembles drawing a map after traveling through unfamiliar territory in [[map-and-territory]]. At first, I believed the real challenge lay in the unpredictable journey itself, filled with strange detours, dead ends, and unknown marshes. Yet my understanding has shifted. The difficulty does not reside in the traveling; it lies, instead, in knowing precisely when to begin the cartography.

Unlike work that has clear, concrete goals like hitting a benchmark or proving a mathematical theorem, some projects are inherently ambiguous. They bend and transform as they progress. For such work, no clear guideposts exist to mark the endpoint. Not even a established criteria define what the shape of the destination would look like. Will we discover a hidden lake in the forest? A mountain peak with a magnificent view? Perhaps an ancient tree standing alone in a valley? The only thing you can do is persist in exploring the terrain before us, solving each problem as it emerges.
Eventually, you recognize the months and years we have spent in these woods. Your work accumulates around, scattered fragments of ideas, meeting notes, endless prototypes, manuscripts gathered like leaves. Yet you konw you must continue, and continue is the only path that you will never need to afraid of making wrong decision.


One day, you finally reach a hilltop and glimpse a peak directly in your path. The joy of this moment is profound, dissolving all the weariness and tears of those long, uncertain years.
But then comes the peculiar paralysis.
You just simply cannot move forward. The legs refuse to carry us to the summit. We start questioning ourselves: Is this truly the peak? Is this genuinely the end goal I sought? Is this the final piece of the map?
These questions spiral. It transforms into consuming doubt, pinning us to the ground with a weight that failure alone could never achieve. What if this path is wrong? What if the entire map is misguided? What if at some forgotten fork in the road, I made an irrevocable wrong turn? What if a better view lies hidden somewhere else on the mountain?


The woods that once seemed so dangerous have become familiar. You return to them. You force yourself not to look back at that "false" summit. Once more, you begin again another round of prototypes, another draft, another spiral through the uncertain territory that has become both your prison and your refuge.


*It turns out we fear success as much as we fear failure.* We have spent so long in exploration that the endless, uncertain search has become our natural state. We have lived in ambiguity for so long that its absence frightens us. We cannot release even a preliminary version of our work because to finish would mean the search has ended, the territory has been mapped, the journey is complete. To finish, we sense, is to accept that things are finite. Yet, we are not confident in defining what it means to be "finished," "ended," or "completed."


### The Fear of Being Seen
Maybe the real fear of success comes from the fear of being seen. Not just evaluated, but truly witnessed. And from being seen comes judgment, accountability, and the loss of infinite possibility, as [The Art of Finishing](https://www.bytedrum.com/posts/art-of-finishing/) described.
When work stays in the woods, unfinished and unreleased, it remains potential. It could be brilliant. It could change everything. Nobody can prove otherwise because nobody has seen it—only the labmates who have been thinking about similar problems anyway.
You can always imagine it being better, deeper, more important in your mind.
But the moment you release it, that protection vanishes. The work becomes fixed. Real. Open to the world's interpretation. Success means your work will be read, discussed, potentially disagreed with. Success means people will have actual opinions about what you made, not imagined ones.
And that is terrifying in a way failure never is. Failure stays hidden as in academia it means that its not published.


Yet in chasing [[big-idea]] and being smug about refusing easy shortcuts, we miss what could have been right in front of us. We become so caught up in the infinite possibility of the path that we forget: sometimes the map itself, imperfect though it may be, is the destination.

Sometimes the beginning is the answer to when to begin.


### Confidently Release the First Version
Maybe we should not consider success as the wrap, the end goal, but as a commemorable checkpoint. It is okay that the first release does not explain everything perfectly, as long as we are honest about what it does and does not address. Because no matter how hard you polish a paper, one year later when we revisit those sentences we will be like: "How did I write that?" And that is okay.
Sometimes sciense is like art that there is no finality. Claude Monet opened up the space of impressionist painting, and that allowed Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, and Camille Pissarro to flourish in the field. Each painting could have been refined more, touched up on color and technique, endlessly perfected. But those paintings record the thought at that moment. Even the imperfect parts, even the mistakes, they are still beautiful.

Only after you release once can people engage with your thinking. Some disagree thoughtfully. Some build on it. And suddenly, from this released place, you can see further than you ever could in the woods.
The work that was stuck becomes part of something larger. You receive feedback you never could have invented alone. You discover you were wrong about what mattered, and that discovery leads somewhere new.
And honestly, opening up and inviting people into the territory is arguably more beneficial to the community than guarding it, claiming it. Because frankly speaking, there will always be people smarter than us who can solve the problem more cleverly. Doesn't has to be us.

I do hope the field, at least in HCI, can be more generous to incomplete work. Can acknowledge that the effort required to make something honest enough to share is real, and the courage to release it is precious. These incomplete works are not failures waiting to be fixed. They are invitations.
So to us as researchers, release it confidently! Release it with honesty about what you understand and what you do not yet understand. Be proud to claim that as a success. 
Not the success of a finished thing, but the success of something that moves.


The summit will still be there. But so will the path forward.
