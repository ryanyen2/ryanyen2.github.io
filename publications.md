# Publications

I have been exploring different approaches to programming interfaces, focusing on making programming more intuitive, accessible, and expressive:

## Research Projects

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/hold-code.svg" alt="Hold Code Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[Semi-formal Programming]]: Something In Between Formal Spec and Informal Representation
*CHI 2025 Tools for Thought Workshop*

Semi-formal Programming explores the middle ground between formal specifications and informal representations in programming, focusing on the interplay between abstract thought and concrete implementation.

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/draw-pad.svg" alt="Draw Pad Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[Code Shaping]]: Iterative Code Editing with Free-form Sketching
*CHI 2025, Best Paper Award (Top 1%)*

Code Shaping introduces a novel approach to code editing through free-form sketching gestures, allowing developers to edit code through approximate structural representations.

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/ladder.svg" alt="Ladder Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[CoLadder]]: Manipulating Code Generation via Multi-Level Blocks
*UIST 2024*

CoLadder provides a structured approach to code generation, organizing content in multi-level blocks that can be easily manipulated and modified.

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/collab-file.svg" alt="Collaboration Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[CoPrompt]]: Supporting Prompt Sharing and Referring in Collaborative Natural Language Programming
*CHI 2024*

CoPrompt facilitates collaborative programming by enabling teams to share, reference, and build upon each other's prompts in natural language programming environments.

## Information Space Research

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/photos.svg" alt="Photos Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[Memolet]]: Reifying the Reuse of User-AI Conversational Memories
*UIST 2024*

Memolet explores how conversational history can be reified into reusable components, enabling more efficient interactions with AI assistants.

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/search-web.svg" alt="Search Web Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> [[To Search or To Gen?]]: Exploring the Synergy between Generative AI and Web Search in Programming
*CHI 2024 LBW*

This study investigates the complementary relationship between generative AI tools and traditional web search in programming tasks, identifying patterns and strategies for effective tool use.

### <img src="/assets/images/icons/search-doc.svg" alt="Search Doc Icon" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: top;"> Scholarly Exploration via Conversations: Conversations with Scholars-Papers Embedding
*IEEE VIS 2024 Poster*

A system supporting exploration of academic literature through interactive visualizations of latent space embeddings with conversational interfaces.
