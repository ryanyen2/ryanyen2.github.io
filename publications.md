# Publications

I have been exploring different approaches to programming interfaces, focusing on making programming more intuitive, accessible, and expressive:

## Research Projects

### [[Code Shaping]]: Iterative Code Editing with Free-form Sketching
*CHI 2025, Best Paper Award (Top 1%)*

Code Shaping introduces a novel approach to code editing through free-form sketching gestures, allowing developers to edit code through approximate structural representations.

### [[CoLadder]]: Manipulating Code Generation via Multi-Level Blocks
*UIST 2024*

CoLadder provides a structured approach to code generation, organizing content in multi-level blocks that can be easily manipulated and modified.

### [[CoPrompt]]: Supporting Prompt Sharing and Referring in Collaborative Natural Language Programming
*CHI 2024*

CoPrompt facilitates collaborative programming by enabling teams to share, reference, and build upon each other's prompts in natural language programming environments.

## Information Space Research

### [[Memolet]]: Reifying the Reuse of User-AI Conversational Memories
*UIST 2024*

Memolet explores how conversational history can be reified into reusable components, enabling more efficient interactions with AI assistants.

### [[To Search or To Gen?]]: Exploring the Synergy between Generative AI and Web Search in Programming
*CHI 2024 LBW*

This study investigates the complementary relationship between generative AI tools and traditional web search in programming tasks, identifying patterns and strategies for effective tool use.

### [[Scholarly Exploration via Conversations]]: Conversations with Scholars-Papers Embedding
*IEEE VIS 2024 Poster*

A system supporting exploration of academic literature through interactive visualizations of latent space embeddings with conversational interfaces.
