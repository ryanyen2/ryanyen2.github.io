# Publications

I have been exploring different approaches to programming interfaces, focusing on making programming more intuitive, accessible, and expressive:

## Research Projects

### <a href="/publications/code-shaping" class="wiki-link">Code Shaping</a>: Iterative Code Editing with Free-form Sketching
*ACM CHI 2023*

Code Shaping introduces a novel approach to code editing through free-form sketching gestures, allowing developers to edit code through approximate structural representations.

### <a href="/publications/coladder" class="wiki-link">CoLadder</a>: Manipulating Code Generation via Multi-Level Blocks
*UIST 2023*

CoLadder provides a structured approach to code generation, organizing content in multi-level blocks that can be easily manipulated and modified.

### <a href="/publications/coprompt" class="wiki-link">CoPrompt</a>: Supporting Prompt Sharing and Referring in Collaborative Natural Language Programming
*IEEE VIS 2022*

CoPrompt facilitates collaborative programming by enabling teams to share, reference, and build upon each other's prompts in natural language programming environments.

## Information Space Research

### <a href="/publications/memolet" class="wiki-link">Memolet</a>: Reifying the Reuse of User-AI Conversational Memories
*ACM CSCW 2023*

Memolet explores how conversational history can be reified into reusable components, enabling more efficient interactions with AI assistants.

### <a href="/publications/search-or-gen" class="wiki-link">To Search or To Gen?</a>: Exploring the Synergy between Generative AI and Web Search in Programming
*ACM CHI 2023*

This study investigates the complementary relationship between generative AI tools and traditional web search in programming tasks, identifying patterns and strategies for effective tool use.
